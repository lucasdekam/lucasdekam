## Hi, I'm Lucas ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a PhD student interested in statistical physics, electrochemistry, and machine learning. My current projects include:

* ðŸ¤– Simulations of electrochemical processes using machine-learning interatomic potentials. I'm training potentials for the platinum-aqueous electrolyte interface, and want to use them for calculation reaction energy barriers with metadynamics.

* âœ¨ Physics of electrochemical interfaces. For example, I implemented a [modified Poisson-Boltzmann model](https://github.com/lucasdekam/frumkin), describing how charges distribute at charged metal-water interfaces.
